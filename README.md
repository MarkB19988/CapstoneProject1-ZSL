## I. Introduction

In this game, the player(s) aim is to uncover facts and information that is hidden underneath a row of 'cards'. The player must move these cards and put them in order on a different row in order to reveal the hidden information. The game is being designed and made for ZSL and as such, the information included on and underneath the cards is to do with the greenhouse gas chain for 4 different products (Plastic bottles, Mobile Phones, Beef, and Electronics being left on standby) and the cards themselves are each step of the chain.

## II. Game Objective

The objective/purpose of this game is to teach children aged 11-16 about the steps that go in to making each of the 4 products, and raise awareness about how much greenhouse gas is produced. The game will also tell the player(s) how they can help to reduce the ammount of greenhouse gasses released.

## III. Genre

The game is a 2D, top down, educational puzzle solving game.

## VI. Features

- 2D Top Down
- Interactive
- Educational
- Web Based
- Tocuh Screen Support

### Included Text

This section will detail what text is to be included in the game.

All the text shown here will be placed on the cards that the player has to drag and drop into the correct order. Each card will contain one step. The first and last steps of the chain will be already in place for the players to give them somewhere to begin.

8. Carbon released when electricity is used every time the phone is charged
9. Carbon released as raw materials continue to be mined if the phone is not recycled

## V. Platform

The choice of platform for the game to run on provided more of a problem than we originally anticipated. The problem was that ZSL wanted the game to run on Apple iPads for use in their sessions at whipsnade zoo, but also wanted the game to be accessible to anyone at home regardless of device. Our original solution to this problem involved us building different versions of the app for use on different platforms (iOS, Android and windows), however this presented two big issues. The first issue was one of time, with the time alloted by ZSL we felt we would not have been able to produce 3 different versions of the game before the deadline. The second issue was one of cost. To develop for iOS one must aquire a Apple developer license that costs roughly £70 and neither us nor ZSL could commit the funds to obtain this license, which would leave us unable to develop for iOS therefore the app would not be usable on iPads, which was a key requirement. This led us to come up with our final solution, which was to make the game web based. A web based game would allow multiple platforms including iPads, to access and llay the game without having to make multiple versions for each operating system and after we consulted with ZSL, this was agreed to be the best solution.

## VI. Designing

### Concept Drawing:
|Explination:| Concept art:|
| -------------- | -------------- |
|The selection screen was a combined design as we all had the same idea for this screen, we wanted it to be simplistic as well as asphetically appealing. we wanted the player to be able to pick and choose from all 4 habitats and see a visual representation of each one.| ![selection screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996215-fbd55924-cd77-11e7-98f4-a6dcc7221d1f.PNG)|
|We originally wanted to have an animation once the player clicked on the habitat that they wanted to play. it was going to be a simple animation that would enlarge the graphic so you can see it clearer whilst loading the buttons which are added in the image below.|![animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996235-249363f6-cd78-11e7-8528-a12bcf8fc81e.PNG)|
|As you can see from the image to the right, we wanted the habitat that you selected to enlarge enough to see more detail but we also wanted the player to still be able to see the other habitats under it. We did not want the selected habitat to take over the whole screen.|![habitat screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32996250-48c0be0e-cd78-11e7-9f4e-9c4c17edfc6b.PNG)|


# Project Management Documentation

##### Mark Biswell, Sam Pearce, Ryan Edwards & George Haughton

## I. Project Overview
We have been contracted by ZSL (Zoological Society of London) to design and produce an educational game based around the greenhouse gas chain for 4 different products, Plastic Bottles, Mobile Phones, Beef and Electronics that are left on stand-by. The game is to be used in classes the ZSL run at London Zoo for 11-16 year olds, the first of which will be run on the 14th November 2017. We will be having regular meetings with the client to collect feedback on our ideas and keep the client satisfied.

### Project Objective
The objective for this project is to create an interactive, educational game that runs on Apple iPads. The game will be played by 11-16 year olds who are visiting ZSL to learn about the greenhouse gas chain. The game needs to teach the children what the different stages of the greenhouse gas chain are and also how they can reduce their greenhouse gas footprint.



### Tools and Techniques

#### Tools 

##### Photoshop 

We used Photoshop to create are 4 habitat backgrounds. Which saved us money instead of buying them from a web source which can be expensive. We also used Photoshop to create the maze in are first prototype of our game. Photoshop was also used to create the greenhouse gas meter on the right hand side

##### Github 

As a group we used GitHub a lot to trade documentation between all of us as when we were not in class it was harder to send work to each other and we also used it to keep a backup every one uploaded work there and when a certain person needed something they knew where to go. We also used it to make a glossary for the finished ZSL project where we had all are finished documentation

##### Unity 

We used Unity to create are application. We figured unity was the best to use as a group of 4 we could all work on it at the same time and then upload it for each other so we could complete it faster. It was also easy to use and had a lot of assists which we used as we were only starting out on the program.

##### Power Point 

We used Power Point for are presentations, first when she came in to see are ideas and concept designs we made a short presentation to show off the ideas so it was easy for her to see what are ideas where. We also used Power Point to present are final game to them when we went to Whipsnade zoo. We showed are finished design and how we adapted to feed back. The reason we used Power Point was that it is the simplest and best presentation software out there. We also used Power Point online so all four of us could work on different slides for the certain parts of work that each person did.

#### Techniques 

##### Interviews 

We had multiple interviews with ZSL. The first one was when Michelle came in to tell us about the project and what she wants at the end of it. We all took notes so that we could get more information from what she was saying as well as off the Power Point she had. The other Interview we did was when we were at ZSL presenting are final game.

##### Prototyping 

We used prototyping when was creating are game in Unity we tested everything after doing sections of code and saving backups all the time. We also loaded up separate Unity programs to test certain parts to see if each part was working so if we had a problem when we put it together it would be easier to find the problem

##### Presentations 

We presented are game in a presentation as it is easy to get your points across and it captures people’s attention when you are standing at the front of the room and have your presentation behind you. You can also use your body language and speaking skills to help present your work and get it across


## II. Schedule/Plan

#### Gantt Chart
![zsl-gant-chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32982650-aa66be46-cc7f-11e7-812b-7c7ca76f7c94.PNG)

#### What Times Are We Available
To manage our time effectively we first had to have a team meeting about what times everyone is available for this project. We knew that all of us were able to work on the project on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesday however all our members have other work commitments outside of college. Saturday and Sunday were ruled out as all of us worked over the weekend, this left Thursday and Friday. Thankfully only Sam was unavailable on Thursdays so we could use all of Friday for outside work and Me, Ryan and George could work on Thursday if needed.

#### What Are The Deadlines
Below are the deadlines for various sections of this project, usually these deadlines are when we are due to present something or to provide a demo to the client.

###### First Client Meeting - 2nd of October 2017
On the 2nd of October, a representative from ZSL will be coming into the college to give a presentation on what they want from the game. This will include information of what information needs to be included in the game, what the game should look like, the genre of game, the target audience and the date for completion.

###### Concept Pitch - 17th of October 2017
On the 17th of October, We will be going to ZLS whipsnade zoo to deliver our concept and ideas for the app we have designed. For this we have created a powerpoint presentation that talks about the features the app will have and how it will look. It will include concept art of the main menu and in-game scenes.

###### Demo Presentation - 7th of November 2017
On the 7th of November, we will be going again to ZSL whipsnade zoo to demo our product to the client. For this we will create another powerpoint that shows the client how to play the game, and we will be allowing the client representatives to play the game on iPads while we present.


##### Problems Solving Techniques Used

###### Contingency Plans
As a contingency plan, incase their are problems with the computers that prevent us from showing our presentation, we have printed out handouts to give to the ZSL representatives that includes all of the relevent images and information. This will enable us to still provide them with a good understanding of what the game will contain and how it will look even if we cannot use the presentation to help us. We will also have with us back-ups of our presentation on multiple USB drives so that if one gets corrupted or the USB itself is lost or damaged, we will still have access to a copy. We have online back-ups also, however we cannot guarantee internet access at the pitch so a local copy was deemed necessary.

###### Trial and Error
When we arrived at ZSL we had to use our USB copy of the presentation to load from due to issues with google slides. However when we inserted our USB there was an error and the drive could not be read. We quickly decided that trial and error would be the best way to try and resolve this problem as fast as possible. We first tried to repair the USB using the windows tools however this was did not work. Secondly we tried a different USB port on the computer but the same error happened again. Finally, after this trial and error we decided to try out back up USB. This worked correctly and we had no further issues with the presentation.

###### Problem Breakdown
We encountered an iussue with out presentation in that some of our graphics were not displaying correctly when we views the presentation. so we thought that the best course of action was to breakdown the problem and try to find why this error was occouring. firstly we cheked to make sure that the the image files we used were displying correctly using a normal image viewer, they were, so the files being corrupted were not an issue. After breaking down the problem further we discovered that we had issues with the transparency of the image in powerpoint itself and we easily rectified the situation.

##### Time Alloted

We have 15 days from the first client meeting to come up with our game idea and create a presentation to give to the client. For this we have allocated a time frame of 10 days to complete these tasks, this is to allow for 5 days extra incase something goes wrong (e.g. personal illness of a team memeber) so that we do not miss the deadline. 

The first 4 days will be dedicated to coming up with our game concept. This will include us creating concept art that we can show the client so that they can have a clear picture of what we intend to make. We will need to decide on the goal of the game, how the player will interact with the game and how the information will be conveyed to the player. We expect this to take less time than creating the presentation itself so we have allocated less time to the concept phase

The next 6 days will be used to create the presentation that we will be giving to the client on the 17th of October. We have allocated more time to this as we want to make the presentation as professional as possible. We will also need to create contingency plans incase something goes wrong during the presentation, such as a computer crash, so that we can contiue to present without a powerpoint. For these reasons we have given ourselves more time to complete all of these things.

## III. First Client Meeting (2nd October 2017)

## V. Concept Pitch (17th October 2017)

For our concept pitch, we traveled to ZSL Whipsnade to meet with the client. Before the meeting we had created a short powerpoint presentation with an idea of how we visioned the game as well as a few concept art designs to show where we wanted each element to go. Once the presentation was over we asked for feedback and questions to help us improve our idea and vision for the game. Below is a list of the feedback we recieved after the presentation.

### Preparation 

In order to prepare for this pitch our team will need to divide the work up evenly between the 4 of us. This is how we decided to divide the work.

##### Sam and Ryan (Powerpoint)

Sam and Ryan will be responsible for creating the powerpoint and the concept art that will be included in the presentation. Sam will be focusing more on creating the concept art and Ryan will be more focused on adding the informtaion on features to the powerpoint. We decided to put 2 of us to work on this because the powerpoint is the main asset we will need during the pitch so we wanted to make sure it was completed on time and to a high standard.

##### George (Handouts)

George will be responsible for creating the handouts that will be given to the members of ZSL present at the pitch. The handouts will need to include the same information as on the powerpoint but more condensed as to fit on no more than 2 A4 pages. To make sure the information is the same. George will still be working closely with Ryan as he is the one writing the information for the powerpoint.

##### Myself (Script/Notes)

I will be responsible for creating notes for me to use when I give the presentation. For this I will need to work with Ryan to make sure that what I talk about is included in the powerpoint and vice versa. While I wont be having a full script to read from during the presentation, we felt it good to make a script so that I have a memory of what to talk about along side the notes.

##### Was This Effective?



### Communication Styles

#### Verbal and Visual
Our concept pitch will consist of a power point presentation that I will stand up and present to the client. The powerpoint will have basic images and notes for the client to look at while I give a talk about our game, I will be explaining to the client our ideas and giving them more information and detail to complement what they are seeing on screen.

###### Concept art
Included in the powerpoint will be draft concept images for the main menu of the game and of the in-game screen. This is to give the client a visual representation of what they can expect the game to look like. We can use this opportunity to collect feedback on what they like and what they don't like and make changes accordingly.

###### Features
Also included is information on the features and mechanics of the game. As we are not giving them a demo of the game we have more concept images that can be used to show them how the game will function. For example, we will have to show the client how the player will move the characters so we will be using diagrams to show the different actions the player will have to do (e.g. Pinch, tap) in order to perform each funtion

#### Written

###### Handouts
We will also be providing handouts to the members of ZSL that are present at the concept pitch for them to keep. These handouts will have the same information on them as the powerpoint, but having a physical copy allows the representative to refer back to the presentation even after we have finished and enables them to share our ideas with people that wern't present at the meeting.

#### Body Language

###### Gesture and Movement
During the presentation I will be walking around the stage and using gestures to point out key information on the screen or to build enthusiasm for the project. By staying mobile while presenting I will show more confidence to the client and they will be more engaged in the presentation.


## Quantitative Research (Survey)

In order to make sure that our ideas were suitable for the client, we needed to conduct some research to see if people agreed with us. To do this we designed a quantitative survey that we gave out to many of our class mates and other students to see what they thought of our design. The questions had answers ranging from 1 to 10, with 1 being 'Strongly Disagree' and 10 being 'Strongly Agree'. In total we asked 15 classmates and other students to fill out this survey on our game. Each person was show the following 3 images of our game (With a description of what is happening) and were asked the following questions

#### Question 1. The artistic design shown is suitable for children aged between 11 - 16.
##### Average Response - 7.7

The mean average answer we got for this question was a 7.7. This was a strong indication that our art style was close to what people would expect form a childrens game but there may be certain aspects that could be improved. We decided that we would need to ask questions to the client to get a more detailed response on the art style.

#### Question 2. The game CLEARLY conveys the greenhouse gas chain information.
##### Average Response - 6.2

The mean average for this question was concerningly quite low at just 6.2. This made it clear that there were issues with how we were presenting the information to the player. This meant that the game would not meet the educational requirement that the client has set for us. For this reason we immediately began to rethink how we could make the information more easily accessible to the player and planned to collect alot of additional feedback on this from the client.

#### Question 3. The game looks simple and intuitive to play (Easy Controls and Easy to Play).
##### Average Response - 8.1

This question was asked to make sure that the game could quickly be picked up and played as each game session at ZSL was only supposed to last for 5 minutes. This meant that there was no time for the player to learn the controls beforehand so they had to be intuitive. We got an average response of 8.1 on this question. This showed us that out simple arrow button interface was as intuitive as we hoped it to be so we didnt feel like we had to make changes to our control scheme.

#### Question 4. The game looks fun and engaging.
##### Average Response - 5.9

This question would be more difficult for the person to answer as they did not bave a version of the game to play at the time. Although this was the case we felt that it would be useful to get rough idea of people's opinions. However we already knew thst further testing was needed once a demo was finished. The response to this was mixed, averaging 5.9 with highs of 9 and lows of 3. This was expected for this question because as stated before, this question is more difficult to answer without access to a demo. However it gave some indication that work was needed to make the game more engaging.

## Qualitative Research (Client Feedback)

After we had delivered out concept pitch. We openly asked the client for any feedback, good or bad, on our ideas in order to collect more detailed information on our ideas and how they meet or do not meed their needs.

The client was overall pleased with the graphics and visual stlyle we have used, stating that 'The art style makes the game look very engaging to the young target audience' However they expressed concern that perhaps as we had used a more cartoon style for our art work, the older side of the target audience would not appreciate the game and take the information it provided seriously. They made the recommendation of maybe making two versions with small graphical differences in order 

One key point that the client was particularly vocal about was how we were going to present the information on the greenhouse gas chain to the player. They did not feel that we had made the greenhouse gas chain the main focus of the game and inturn did not belive that our design in its current state would meet their needs. They did provide us with alot of feedback about how they thought the game could be improved. The main point they raised is that we were not including every step of the chain in each maze, saying that 'All of the information needs to be present in order for the game to relate to what we will be teaching the children'. From our survey we thought that our way of presenting the information was not working as well as we had hoped so having some more detailed feedback on this was needed. The client recommended that we focus less on the maze and make the information bigger so it becomes the main focus for the player.

One final concern that the client raised was that of difficulty. The client felt that the maze looked too simple and would not keep the player(s) engaged for the full 5 minutes they required. We had thought about this previously so having some feedback on this was welcomed. Increasing the difficult or length of the maze would not be a difficult task so we made this a low priority as the client also stated that without a demo they could be wrong.

## Analysis of the Research (Meeting With Client and Student Survey)

From the answers we recieved from our questions and what the client told us we were able to extrapolate the following key feedback:

Noted feedback:
* Maze screen - want the chain to be the main feature/focus.
* Show the whole cycle of each product.
* Increase the difficulty of each maze.
* Appeal to younger and older(different graphic options).
* More detailed graphics(Rainforest).
* Two different settings for different ages.
* Want to see the full affect of the greenhouse gases.
* Dont make the maze the full focus.
* Come back to the maze after each chain.

As you can see from the feedback above, there were a few things that we needed to do straight away and a few things that were suggested that were not so important. The client suggested that we make the main focus the chain instead of the maze idea, this was the main focus that we had after the meeting. the other comments about the graphics and the setting for two different age options was more of a suggestion if we had time, this allowed us to fully focus on the chain concept and if we had time, we could possibly impliment the option for two different age groups.

## VI. Adapting to Feedback
Below we will break down each point of feedback and explain how we adapted our designs and ideas for the game:
1. "Maze screen - want the chain to be the main feature/focus" - After the presentation, we sat down and decided that it was best to remove the maze as a whole and make the chain the sole focus. By doing this it would dramatically reduce our work load as well as appeal more to what the client wants.
2. "Show the whole cycle of each product." - Like in the above point, we were able to reach this outcome by making the chain the main focus of the game, this then allowed us to include the full chain which is what the client wanted.
3. "Increase the difficulty of each maze." - Like the above two points, we completely removed the maze feature from the game which means this point no longer applies to the game.
4. "Appeal to younger and older(different graphic options)." - We decided to leave this point to be one of the last things to work on as the client said they would like the option for this however it was not mandatory to do so.
5. "More detailed graphics(Rainforest)." - After the presentation we worked to changing the rainforest graphic to make it look more realistic and belivable. This was a very straightfoward task and did not require each member to work on so it was done quickly by one member whilst the others worked on implimenting other features.
6. "Two different settings for different ages." - This feedback is basically the fourth point where the client suggested that we make a option to change the graphics depending on the age of the players. we put this at the bottom of our priorities because like mentioned above, it was only a suggestion not a mandatory feature.
7. "Want to see the full affect of the greenhouse gases." - We planned to have the graphic elements of the game change as they completed the chain. This would have provided a visual representation of how the affects of each stage change our planet which would hopefully trigger a realisation for the player.
8. "Dont make the maze the full focus." - Like in the first point, we completly removed the maze so that we could make the chain the main focus, this would in turn get the message to the player quicker and more efficently.
9. "Come back to the maze after each chain." - We had the idea to possibly incorperate the maze back in the game if we had time however we did not get around to doing so as we felt the chain provided the correct amount of play time for each habitat.

| -------------- | -------------- |:----------------:|
| As you can see from the images to the right, the only real change was the top right graphic as the client felt that it was not a true representation of how the real habitat looks like.| ![zsl-habitat-screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/32994252-61a2f278-cd5c-11e7-8b80-32b72ada6740.png)| ![zsl-menu-final](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33014287-beb31e0c-cdde-11e7-985c-0ba86f1f630b.png)|

| Rainforest graphic:               | Before Feedback:        | After Feedback:           |
| -------------- | -------------- |:----------------:|
| Like above, the rainforest graphic was the main change of the visual elements, the client said that it was too unrealistic as it did not look dense enough. To improve the overall look of this graphic we increased the density by downloading a few free brushes which allowed us to get a better looking design.| ![zsl-jungle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33013646-a70ff466-cddc-11e7-90c0-39b75b71b5a6.png)| ![zsl-jungle-recovered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33013662-c0e8f7fc-cddc-11e7-8954-cce5c5a0d505.jpg)|

| Game Screen:               | Before Feedback:        | After Feedback:           |
| -------------- | -------------- |:----------------:|
| With the original concept art we felt that it looked a little too cartoony. With the major change being the removal of the maze we decided to make the elements appeal to the client more, in order to do so we needed to add a lot more information on the screena about the chain.| ![zsl-game-screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33013769-13a112ea-cddd-11e7-9a8e-c43e99f727f8.png)| ![zsl-ocean-game-screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31927590/33014075-eacb21f2-cddd-11e7-9020-0d18243f677f.png)|
